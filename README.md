## In Prose

Doris, from Dôron and Zôros, meaning "abundance" and "pure and unmixed",
representing the bountiful fertility of the ocean. The web is our ocean, the
fish the morsels of knowledge that may elude us with their cunning. With the
gracious help of Doris, we may improve our harvest and thus our knowledge.
